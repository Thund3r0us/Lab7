Counting number of swaps for Bubble Sort and Selection Sort

The reason why the total number of swaps is not equal to the sum of the swaps for each value because if you swap index 1 and 2, each element has been incremeneted 1 swap, but the overall number of swaps increments by 1, since 1 swap happened to move the two elements.
